# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

I have successfully accomplished the checklist for week 1. As a part of my homework challenges, I was able to download docker on my local machine and used containers as well. I also did some research on the best practices and use- cases for docker. I also tried playing around with the Docker Images.
Oops Moment: While creating a docker file, I named it as DockerFile instead of Dockerfile. That resulted in a lot of debugging and research.
