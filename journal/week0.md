OBSTACLES: 1) Gitpod - This was the very first time I heard the service called Gitpod. But It was fun learning about it and It got even better after working with it.
           2) Balance the difference between the conceptual and logical architecture diagrams.
           
EXCITING MOMENTS: Glad and Honoured to be a part of the Bootcamp, Learning certain details about the gitpod.
