# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

I have successfully accomplished all the tasks on the checklist i.e. Instrumenting HoneyComb with OTEL, Implementing AWS X-ray, AWS Xray Subsegments, and Integrating the Rollbar.
As a part of the Homework challenges, I have implemented additional custom spans for the Notifications. I had also run different types of queries in AWS Xray as well as in HoneyComb using the custom spans.
