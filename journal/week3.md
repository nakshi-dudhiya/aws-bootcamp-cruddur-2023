# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

I have successfully accomplished all the tasks for Week 3 i.e. Set up a Cognito User Pool, Implement Custom Sign-in Page,  Sign-up Page, Confirmation Page, and Custom Recovery Page. Also verified the JWT token server side. Updated the UI of the Home page.
Used vars for the CSS. Also, researched different approaches to verify JWTS. As a part of the homework challenge, researched adding different 3 party apps for login.
